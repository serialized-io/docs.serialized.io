# Multi-Tenancy

## What is Multi-Tenancy?

In order to build business-to-business applications where the application serves many customers it is common to build a multi-tenant system. This means that multiple customers share the use of the same system instance but their data is separated at the storage level.

Serialized provides a convenient way of building multi-tenant systems by enabling this feature on project level.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Multi-tenancy is only supported on our paid plans

See the Tenants API for details on how to use the multi-tenancy support.
