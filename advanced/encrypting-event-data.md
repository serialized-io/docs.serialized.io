# Encrypting Event data

If you need to store personal or sensitive data in your events you can populate the field`encryptedData`, which is reserved for this kind of client-side encrypted data. This field will not be processed in any way and can contain anything packed into a `string`.

Preferably you encrypt a JSON payload using symmetric encryption. Remember to keep the secret key safe! As you are not sharing the key with us, thereâ€™s no way we can help you recover it or access your encrypted data if you loose it. Note that the field is limited to max `65535` bytes.

Example event payload utilizing the `encryptedData` field:

```javascript
{
  "events": [
    {
      "eventId": "127b80b5-4a05-4774-b870-1c9a2e2a27a3",
      "eventType": "OrderPlacedEvent",
      "encryptedData": "9cb2948ea01673aea153ef5a9618d4debf2c90385ec958470fc13...",
      "data": {
        "customerId": "some-test-id-1",
        "orderAmount": 12345
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
