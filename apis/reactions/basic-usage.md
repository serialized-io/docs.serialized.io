# Basic Usage

Reactions are configured to react to a specific event and trigger an action whenever that event is processed by the event reactor. An example could be sending a confirmation email to a customer when an order has been successfully placed.

It is not possible for a Reaction to trigger on an event that has happened in the past. Reactions are always configured to listen to events from the moment when the Reaction is configured.

## Actions

Each reaction is configured with a specific Action that defines what will happen when the reaction is triggered. When a Reaction is triggered it will execute its configured Action.

Currently Serialized offer three pre-defined action types, for [Slack](https://slack.com/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Automate](https://automate.io/), and a generic HTTP action for any system capable of receiving HTTP POST:s.

## HTTP Action

The action type \(`HTTP_POST`\) requires the field `targetUri` to be populated with the address that should receive the POST request. Optionally the field `httpHeaders` can be set, i.e. to handle Basic Authentication etc.

### Receiving reaction requests

The reaction requests are HTTP POST requests with a JSON body. The JSON has the following format:

```javascript
{  
   "metadata":{  
      "aggregateId":"<some-aggregate-id>",
      "timestamp": <epoc-millis>,
      "sequenceNumber": <n>
   },
   "event":{  
      "eventId":"<some-event-id>",
      "eventType":"<event-type>",
      "data":{  
         "key":"value",
         "key":"value",
         ...
      }
   }
}
```

### Securing the external endpoint

As the end-point specified in the `targetUri` must be exposed to the public internet it should be protected. Currently itâ€™s possible to utilize Basic Authentication and include the appropriate HTTP header in the Reaction definition.

```javascript
{
  "reactionName": "notify-on-order-shipped",
  "feedName": "order",
  "reactOnEventType": "OrderShippedEvent",
  "action": {
    "actionType": "HTTP_POST",
    "targetUri": "https://your-service",
    "httpHeaders": {
      "Authorization": "Basic c2VasXlZdyW2dGsONfM5fD4adleRDgVbDNgRkgFgZUpgoxgNHdsg15QktFcm1ndjI="
    }    
  }
}
```

## Slack Action

The action type \(`SLACK_POST`\) requires the field `targetUri` to be populated with a valid [Slack webhook URI](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks). The message text is specified in the field `body`. Simple templating is supported and event data can be accessed using dot \(.\) notation.

Example of a Reaction posting a notification to Slack:

{% code title="" %}
```javascript
{
  "reactionName": "on-order-placed-slack-notifier",
  "feedName": "order",
  "reactOnEventType": "OrderPlacedEvent",
  "action": {
    "actionType": "SLACK_POST",
    "targetUri": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0000/B0000/XXXX",
    "body": "A new order with number ${event.data.orderNumber} was placed by ${event.data.customer.email}!"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Given this event:

```javascript
{
  "eventId": "ca37d05c-a852-4de5-961f-16fb35e8cd7b",
  "eventType": "OrderPlacedEvent",
  "data": {  
    "orderNumber": "12312345",
    "customer": {
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

the message to Slack will look like this:

`A new order with number 12312345 was placed by customer@example.com!`

## IFTTT Action

The action type \(`IFTTT_POST`\) requires the field `targetUri` to be populated with a valid IFTTT webhook URI (i.e. starting with `https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger`).
The map `valueMap` is used for storing the (up to three) dynamic values supported by IFTTT. Simple templating is supported and event data can be accessed using dot \(.\) notation.

Example of a Reaction posting a request to IFTTT:

{% code title="" %}
```javascript
{
  "reactionName": "payment-notifier",
  "feedName": "payment",
  "reactOnEventType": "CaptureCompleted",
  "action": {
    "actionType": "IFTTT_POST",
    "targetUri": "https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/payment_notification/with/key/<your-key>",
    "valueMap": {
      "value1": "Payment made by ${event.data.customerId} with amount ${event.data.amount}.",
      "value2": "Some more data",
      "value3": "Even more..."
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Given this event:

```javascript
{
  "eventId": "ca37d05c-a852-4de5-961f-16fb35e8cd7b",
  "eventType": "CaptureCompleted",
  "data": {  
    "customerId": "some-test-id-1",
    "amount": 12345
  }
}
```

the request body POST:ed to IFTTT would look like this:

```javascript
{
  "value1": "Payment made by some-test-id-1 with amount 12345.",
  "value2": "Some more data",
  "value3": "Even more..."
}
```

## Automate Action

The action type \(`AUTOMATE_POST`\) requires the field `targetUri` to be populated with a valid Automate.io webhook URI (i.e. starting with `https://wh.automate.io/webhook`).
The map `valueMap` is used for storing the (up to nine) dynamic values. Simple templating is supported and event data can be accessed using dot \(.\) notation.

Example of a Reaction posting a request to Automate.io:

{% code title="" %}
```javascript
{
  "reactionName": "payment-notifier",
  "feedName": "payment",
  "reactOnEventType": "CaptureCompleted",
  "action": {
    "actionType": "AUTOMATE_POST",
    "targetUri": "https://wh.automate.io/webhook/<your-key>",
    "valueMap": {
      "value1": "Payment made by ${event.data.customerId} with amount ${event.data.amount}.",
      ...
      "value9": "Some more data"
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Given this event:

```javascript
{
  "eventId": "ca37d05c-a852-4de5-961f-16fb35e8cd7b",
  "eventType": "CaptureCompleted",
  "data": {  
    "customerId": "some-test-id-1",
    "amount": 12345
  }
}
```

the request body POST:ed to Automate.io would look like this:

```javascript
{
  "value1": "Payment made by some-test-id-1 with amount 12345.",
  ...
  "value9": "Some more data"
}
```

## Automatic retries

Serialized Reactions have a built-in retry mechanism and will be retried several times over the course of a day. A `2xx` response is required for success, whereas a `4xx` or `5xx` response will be treated as an error and retried.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can see all retries and any errors for your executed reactions in the Serialized Console.
