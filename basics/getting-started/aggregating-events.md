  Projections can also be configured to merge events from different aggregates
  which makes it easy to build things such as reporting features or similar.

# Aggregating events

## Creating your first aggregated projection

To illustrate aggregated projections we will create an aggregated projection that counts the amount of paid orders and their total amount. We use a `POST` command to create a new projection definition:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="cURL" %}
```bash
curl -i https://api.serialized.io/projections/definitions \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Serialized-Access-Key: <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>" \
  --header "Serialized-Secret-Access-Key: <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>" \
  --data '
  {
    "projectionName": "order-totals",
    "feedName": "order",
    "aggregated": true,
    "handlers": [
      {
        "eventType": "OrderPlacedEvent",
        "functions": [
          {
            "function": "add",
            "targetSelector": "$.projection.orderAmount",
            "eventSelector": "$.event.orderAmount"
          },
          {
            "function": "inc",
            "targetSelector": "$.projection.orderCount"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  '
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Query an aggregated projection

Since aggregated projections are combinations of multiple aggregates they don’t have any id’s. We query them directly by their name:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="cURL" %}
```bash
curl -i \
  --header "Serialized-Access-Key: <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>" \
  --header "Serialized-Secret-Access-Key: <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>" \
  https://api.serialized.io/projections/aggregated/order-totals
```

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="Response" %}
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 20 Sep 2017 11:45:27 GMT

Connection: keep-alive

{
  "projectionId": "order-totals",
  "updatedAt": 1505850788368,
  "data": {
    "orderAmount":"1000",
    "orderCount":"2"
  }
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Given that we have two `OrderPlacedEvent` that together sum up to 1000 we should get the response above.
